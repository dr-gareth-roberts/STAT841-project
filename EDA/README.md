# Exploratory Data Analysis

## GOAL: 

### 1. Univariate analyses:
Choose only 5-6 meanigful variables, not all variables. 
Show the distributions of the attributes in the data set 
bivariate analyses: to gain insights about the relationships which exist between the response variable and certain features.

(i). Categorical Variables 
â€“ We can show some categorical variables and their corresponding count data, say insurance_history_1, put a bar graph and show which categories correspond to the highest, mid and lowest counts for this attribute.

(ii). Continuous Variables 
- Age, Height, Weight and BMI distributions. Reproduce the distributions of the 4 variables in the supplenmentary_info.doc.

(iii). Response Variable 
- What is the count distribution of the response variable, which risk category corresponds to the maximum number of counts?
 


### 2. Bivariate Analysis:
Hypothesis 1: Does age have a significant impact on the risk level?
Hypothesis 2: Does height vary according to the different response groups?
Hypothesis 3: Does weight have an influence on the risk level?
Hypothesis 4: What is the BMI distribution across the different response groups?
